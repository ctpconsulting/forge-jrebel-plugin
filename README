USAGE

Preparations required:
- Define a JBOSS_HOME environment variable pointing to your JBoss 6 installation
- Define a REBEL_HOME environment variable pointing to your JRebel installation

In Seam Forge, setup a project, make it a web project and run:
forge $ forge git-plugin git://github.com/ctpconsulting/forge-jrebel-plugin.git
forge $ jrebel setup
forge $ jrebel container --named JBOSS6
forge $ build

On a new shell command line:
mvn cargo:start

Back in Seam Forge, use
forge $ mvn compile
when you add source files under src/main/java or src/main/resources. The 'build' command will run a clean, 
which stops JBoss. Any file put under src/main/webapp will be monitored by JRebel directly, no action required.

NOTES
- If you stop JBoss, use mvn clean package cargo:start to restart
- use $ jrebel rebel-xml to regenerate the rebel.xml (e.g. when switching from JAR to WAR packaging)
- Make sure you have run agent-settings.sh/bat and saved an initial configuration,
  otherwise the agent will not be activated in JBoss.
- JRebel up to v4.0 M1a does not yet fully support JBoss 6.
- Tested on OS X and Windows 7, Linux folks: give me a shout.
